-- | The nub function removes duplicate elements from a list.
--
-- In particular, it keeps only the first occurrence of each element.
-- (The name nub means `essence'.)
--
-- Complexity class?

-- .1 nub with filter

nub :: Eq a => [a] -> [a]
nub [] = []
nub (x : xs) = x : (filter (\y -> not (y==x)) (nub xs))


-- .2 nub with list comprehension

nub' :: Eq a => [a] -> [a]
nub' [] = []
nub' (x : xs) = x : (nub' [y |y<-xs, x/=y])


-- .3 nub with foldr
-- after chapter about folds

nub'' l = foldr (\x xs -> x : filter (/=x) xs) [] l

-- | 'splitAt' @n xs@ returns a tuple where first element is @xs@ prefix of
-- length @n@ and second element is the remainder of the list:
--
-- > splitAt 6 "Hello World!" == ("Hello ","World!")
-- > splitAt 3 [1,2,3,4,5] == ([1,2,3],[4,5])
-- > splitAt 1 [1,2,3] == ([1],[2,3])
-- > splitAt 3 [1,2,3] == ([1,2,3],[])
-- > splitAt 4 [1,2,3] == ([1,2,3],[])
-- > splitAt 0 [1,2,3] == ([],[1,2,3])
-- > splitAt (-1) [1,2,3] == ([],[1,2,3])
--
-- It is equivalent to @('take' n xs, 'drop' n xs)@ when @n@ is not @_|_@
-- (@splitAt _|_ xs = _|_@).
-- 'splitAt' is an instance of the more general 'Data.List.genericSplitAt',
-- in which @n@ may be of any integral type.
